This is a Java test program to experimentally compare the performance of the sorting algorithms selection sort, insertion sort, and shell sort. It uses the random method from the Math class to generate 5000 integers, and then stores these generated numbers in arrays. Subsequently, it sorts the elements in the arrays using the sorting algorithms, and for each execution, it records the time it takes to sort the numbers. It measures the execution time of each operation using the System.currentTimeMillis() method.
Note that the unit of time of the return value is a millisecond.
